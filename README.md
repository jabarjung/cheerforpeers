# Cheer For Peers

It's a web tool to send a beautiful email message to say thanks to your amazing co-worker.

## Credits

1. I used PHPMailer to send emails using a SMTP server (https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer).

2. I used PHP GD library to generate an image with text and font embedding (http://papermashup.com/php-gd-generate-an-image-with-text-and-font-embedding/).

3. Google Roboto font was used (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

4. CSS boilerplate to convert raw HTML form to a beautiful minimalistic web-form (https://github.com/siwalikm/quick-form-css).

5. Composer is used to install PHPMailer and GD libraries (https://getcomposer.org).
